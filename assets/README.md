# Eclipse 2023 R1

Eclipse is a mobile application designed to guide customers through the life cycle of their machines.

## About

- [Manufacturing Intelligence | Hexagon](https://hexagon.com/company/divisions/manufacturing-intelligence)

- On conclusion of a service and calibration the application will provide customers with a score or rating based on certain criteria, such as frame type, controller, PCDMIS version, and year of manufacture.

- This score will serve as a future proof indicator and will help customers understand where their machine is positioned within Hexagon's CMM product line and help them prepare for when their machine will no longer benefit from Hexagon hardware support due to its legacy nature.

- In conjunction with the score, Eclipse will recommend which services and contracts are most suited for the customer's machine at this stage in its life cycle. Once a certain threshold has been reached and the customer is no longer able to benefit from contract support for servicing or replacement spare parts, Eclipse will provide recommendations to bring the customer up to a fully supported position.

- Eclipse will establish a connection between the customer and us by providing the customer with a clear understanding of where their machine is positioned within Hexagon's product offerings. This will enable the customer to make informed decisions regarding their machine's lifecycle and potential upgrade or replacement options.

- Recommendations could include a retrofit controller or a new machine if the frame is unsupported, PCDMIS software training or interim servicing should the material condition benefit.

- Once Eclipse has generated an assessment score then the customer will be asked if they would like a call back from a technical sales manager ( a complimentary 10 minute technical overview of the product) to discuss in more detail if the recommendation is suitable for them or for the sales team to provide the customer directly with a quote.
